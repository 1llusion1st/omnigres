## PostgREST

At the time, `omni_rest` provides basic PostgREST compatibility. You can refer to its [documentation](https://postgrest.org/) for details.

!!! warning "PostgREST compatibility is not yet complete"

    Please be aware since this is an early release of `omni_rest`, not
    all functionality is implemented yet. We strived to cover the core
    cases and are iterating on the missing bits.
